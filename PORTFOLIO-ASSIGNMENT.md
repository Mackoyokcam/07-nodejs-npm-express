## Portfolio Assignment for Class 7

It's time to do some refactoring on the portfolio to utilize some of the technical things we've been adding to the labs (maybe you have already done some of these?). Be sure to do each of these tasks on a unique branch, and then push to GitHub, merge into master, and pull back down from master into your local master branch.

- Ensure that your CSS is organized with SMACSS, as we did in Lab 1.
- Use a Handlebars template to render the content into the DOM, as we did with our data in Lab 4.
- Refactor your project data to be stored in JSON, retrieved with AJAX, and passed through a constructor, as we did with blog data in Lab 6.
- Create your own `server.js` file and move all of your other files into a `public/` directory, as we did in Lab 7.
